# Deploy

The site is hosted on Hostinger and deploys two ways, both via FTP:

1. **Automatic** on every push to `main` via GitHub Actions (preferred).
2. **Manual** from your laptop via `bun run deploy` (fallback if Actions
   billing is paused or you want to test before pushing).

## Automatic deploy: GitHub Actions

### Setup (once)

Go to `github.com/chochy2001/jorgesalgadomiranda_landing/settings/secrets/actions`
and create these **four repository secrets**:

| Secret name        | Example value        | Notes                                     |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `FTP_HOST`         | `ftp.jorgesalgadomiranda.com` or `files.hostinger.com` | Same value you'd put in an FTP client |
| `FTP_USER`         | `u1234567`           | Hostinger panel > Files > FTP Accounts     |
| `FTP_PASSWORD`     | `your-real-password` | Password from the same panel               |

> `FTP_REMOTE_DIR` is **no longer required**. Hostinger's FTP user is
> chrooted to `public_html/`, so the workflow uploads to `./` at the
> account root. If the secret still exists it's harmless; you can delete
> it.

Exact names matter. The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` reads
them as `${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}`, etc.

### How it runs

Every push to `main` triggers the workflow. You can also trigger it
manually from the Actions tab using the "Run workflow" button (the
workflow is registered with `workflow_dispatch`).

Flow:
1. `actions/checkout@v4` pulls the repo.
2. `SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.5` mirrors the working tree to the
   FTP server on port 21 (plain FTP; Hostinger doesn't offer FTPS).
3. The action uses the same exclude list as the local deploy script, so
   `.git*`, `.github/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `.env*`, `node_modules/`,
   `bun.lockb`, `package*.json`, `README.md` and `og.html` never leave
   the repo.

Typical duration: 30-60 seconds.

### Status checks

Watch the run live at
`github.com/chochy2001/jorgesalgadomiranda_landing/actions`.

### Finding the exact FTP host value

This is the #1 cause of deploy failures. In Hostinger:

**hPanel > Files > FTP Accounts > your account**

Look for the field labeled **"Hostname"** or **"FTP hostname"**. Common formats:

- `ftp.yourdomain.com` (works only after DNS has an `ftp.` A record)
- `files.XXXXX.hostingersite.com`
- A plain IPv4 address like `46.202.194.123`
- `srv123.hosting.com` (specific Hostinger server)

**Paste that value verbatim** into the `FTP_HOST` secret. Do not include:
- A scheme (no `ftp://` prefix)
- A trailing slash or path (no `/public_html`)
- A port (port goes in the workflow file, currently 21)

If the workflow fails with `ENOTFOUND`, the pre-flight check will tell
you the DNS didn't resolve. Double-check the value in hPanel.

### Other common deploy failures

- **ENOTFOUND**: wrong `FTP_HOST` value (see above).
- **530 Login incorrect**: wrong `FTP_USER` or `FTP_PASSWORD`.
  Double-check in hPanel, especially for trailing whitespace when you
  paste.
- **550 Permission denied**: the FTP user can't write at its landing
  directory. If Hostinger created a non-standard layout for your account
  you may need to set `server-dir` explicitly in `deploy.yml` (e.g.
  `./public_html/`) instead of the default `./`.
- **Site still shows Hostinger placeholder after a green deploy**:
  you're likely double-nested. The chroot already lands you inside
  `public_html/`, so `server-dir: public_html/` would create
  `public_html/public_html/`. Keep `server-dir: ./`.
- **FTPS handshake failure**: if your account doesn't support FTPS,
  change `protocol: ftps` back to `protocol: ftp` in
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Hostinger supports FTPS on port 21
  (explicit TLS); some older accounts may still be plain FTP only.
- **Concurrency lock** from a still-running deploy. The `concurrency`
  block in the workflow serializes deploys so you won't race yourself.

## Manual deploy (fallback)

Requires `lftp` on your machine:

```bash
brew install lftp
cp .env.example .env
# fill in FTP_HOST, FTP_USER, FTP_PASS, FTP_REMOTE_DIR
bun run deploy
```

The script at `scripts/deploy.sh` uses the same exclude list as the
GitHub Actions workflow, so both deploy paths produce byte-identical
remotes.

## What gets uploaded

| File / Dir                          | Uploaded? | Reason                                |

| `og.html`                           | no        | source for og.png, not needed live    |
| `docs/`                             | no        | repo documentation                    |

| `package.json`, `README.md`         | no        | repo metadata                         |

## Rollback

Hostinger does not give you per-file version history. If a deploy breaks
production, the cleanest rollback is:

```bash
git checkout <last-good-commit>
bun run deploy
git checkout main
```

This re-runs the same mirror against the remote with the old file tree,
restoring it. Then switch back to `main` locally so future commits are
based on current.

Alternatively, trigger the GitHub Actions workflow manually pointing at
the last-good commit via the "Run workflow" UI.

## Smoke test before deploy

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1
# open http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

Click through:
- Hero: title renders, code panel shows JSON without horizontal scroll
- Theme toggle: light <-> dark works, persists across reload
- Lang toggle: ES <-> EN works
- About: portrait visible, quick-facts box renders, 4 cards below
- Engineering: 6 cards with kicker (CIMIENTOS, ALCANCE, ...)
- CV button: opens `cv/Jorge_Salgado_Miranda_CV_EN.html`
- PDF download: `assets/cv/Jorge_Salgado_Miranda_CV.pdf` returns 200

## DNS

`jorgesalgadomiranda.com` -> Hostinger nameservers. CNAME for `www` ->
apex. HTTPS handled by Hostinger automatically.

## Third-party tokens to plug in

The repo ships with clearly-labelled `YOUR_*` placeholders. Fill them in
and push — all four are safe to commit because they're scoped to the
public domain and/or don't expose secrets server-side.

| Placeholder                  | Where                                      | Where to get it                                       |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `YOUR_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`      | `<script data-website-id>` in `index.html` | `stats.capdesis.com` → Settings → Websites → Add site |
| `YOUR_CF_BEACON_TOKEN`       | `data-cf-beacon` in `index.html`           | Cloudflare → Analytics & Logs → Web Analytics         |
| `YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY`  | `<input name="access_key">` in `index.html`| web3forms.com — enter an email, get the key instantly |
| `jorgesalgadomiranda/30min`  | `href` on `#cal-cta` button in `index.html`| cal.com → Event Types → copy the slug                 |

After plugging them in:
1. Smoke-test locally (`python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1`)
2. Submit the contact form with a real email — confirm it hits your inbox.
3. Check the Umami dashboard within ~60s to see the visit appear.
4. Check the Cloudflare Web Analytics dashboard within ~5 min.

## Security stack

Defense-in-depth for a static site:

1. **Cloudflare (free plan, proxied DNS)** — WAF, DDoS, bot fight mode,
   client-side security monitor, leaked-credential mitigation. Already
   enabled.
2. **`.htaccess`** — HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP, Referrer-Policy,
   Permissions-Policy, gzip, long-cache immutable assets. Lives at
   repo root, uploaded on every deploy.
3. **FTP password rotation** — rotate `FTP_PASSWORD` secret every
   3-6 months in Hostinger panel and GitHub Secrets.
4. **Watermark in code** — scattered attribution in HTML comment,
   `<meta name="template-origin">`, `--jsm-origin` CSS custom property,
   `data-origin` on `<html>`/`<body>`, JSON-LD `@id`, and a console
   signature. Humans can find it; casual AI-assisted rebrands miss at
   least one.

## Pre-deploy checklist

- [ ] `git status` clean
- [ ] Smoke test on `http://127.0.0.1:8765` passes
- [ ] i18n parity unchanged or improved (run the `EN={n}, ES={n}` Python
      check from `CHANGELOG.md` examples)
- [ ] Commit, push to `main`, watch the Actions tab
